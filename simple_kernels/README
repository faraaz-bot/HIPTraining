Exercise 1:
Create a vector addition kernel which adds one vector to another (ie
a[i] += b[i]) – 1 thread per element

Exercise 2:
Vector addition kernel – 1 thread per element with block size equals
256, and array size not a multiple of 256

Exercise 3:
Vector addition kernel – 4 consecutive elements per thread

Exercise 4:
Vector addition kernel – multiple elements per thread (Grid-stride loop)

Exercise 5:
Matrix addition kernel – 1 thread per element using 2D grid of 2D thread blocks
