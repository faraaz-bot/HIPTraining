# Exercises for Latency Hiding and Occupancy

# Exercise 1: Measure empty kernel launch latency via the empty kernel.

# Exercise 2: Occupancy computation and measurement (via HIP APIs)

# Exercise 3: vector addition, but we add extra LDS to reduce latency

# Exercise 4: thread traace to see stalls
