# Exercises for Latency Hiding and Occupancy

# Exercise 1: Measure empty kernel launch latency via the empty kernel.  See how this is affected by
the number of waves.

# Exercise 2: Occupancy computation and measurement

- via HIP APIs

- hipcc --save-temps and then look at .s file that has the gfx model

# Exercise 3: vector addition, but we add extra LDS to reduce latency
